# SilentPatch for Yakuza 3, Yakuza 4 & Yakuza 5 Remastered

Yakuza Remastered Collection is a collection consisting of Yakuza 3, Yakuza 4, and Yakuza 5,
released on PC in January 2021. While currently all 3 games have been patched officially,
some of the CPU usage issues remain unfixed, and SilentPatch addresses them. Additionally,
SilentPatch improves compatibility for users with non-ASCII characters in user names,
especially in Yakuza 5.

## Featured fixes

* CPU usage has been significantly cut down in all 3 games.
* A low level keyboard hook potentially causing issues with slow typing speed has been removed.
* ~~Worked around a crash occurring occasionally after finishing battles with a Heat Action.~~ **- fixed in an official patch.**
* Fixed a potential random startup crash.
* Fixed several issues related to non-ASCII user names, most notably a freeze when using Print Circle photo booths in Yakuza 5.
